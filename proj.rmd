# Data Access
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

# Load the data
data <- read_csv("Stats survey.csv")

# Inspect the data structure
glimpse(data)

# Data Wrangling
```{r}
# Correctly referencing and renaming the columns as necessary
data <- rename(data,
               Year_in_2023 = `What year were you in last year (2023) ?`,
               Drinks_Consumed = `On a night out, how many alcoholic drinks do you consume?`,
               Classes_Missed = `How many classes do you miss per week due to alcohol reasons, (i.e: being hungover or too tired?)`,
               Socialising_Frequency = `How often do you go out partying/socialising during the week?`)

# Handling missing data and data transformation
df <- data %>%
  mutate(
    Year_in_2023 = ifelse(is.na(Year_in_2023), "HS", Year_in_2023),
    Drinks_Consumed = as.numeric(gsub("\\D", "", Drinks_Consumed)),  # Remove all non-digit characters and convert to numeric
    Socialising_Frequency = case_when(
      Socialising_Frequency == "Only weekends" ~ "3",
      TRUE ~ as.character(Socialising_Frequency)
    ),

  )

# View the transformed data structure and first few rows to confirm changes
glimpse(df)

```

Had to clean some of the data the data itself had a lot of differnt blanks and non nummerical values that we had to filiter out.
# Data Visualization
```{r}
df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Drinks_Consumed), !is.na(Classes_Missed))

df$Drinks_Consumed <- cut(df$Drinks_Consumed, breaks = c(-Inf, 3, 8, Inf), labels = c("1-3", "4-8", "8+"))

ggplot(df, aes(x = Drinks_Consumed, y = Classes_Missed)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  labs(
    x = "Drinks Consumed per night",
    y = "Classes Missed",
    title = "Bar Graph of Classes of Missed based on number of drinks consumed "
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("1-3", "4-8", "8+"))

```

###Smother
```{r}
# Ensure both columns are factors
df$Drinks_Consumed <- as.factor(df$Drinks_Consumed)
df$Classes_Missed <- as.factor(df$Classes_Missed)

# Perform Chi-square test
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(df$Drinks_Consumed, df$Classes_Missed)
chi_square_test

print(df$Classes_Missed)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Drinks_Consumed, y = Classes_Missed)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(
    title = "Hexbin Plot of Drinks Consumed vs. Classes Missed",
    x = "Drinks Consumed (Numeric Approximation)",
    y = "Classes Missed"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
